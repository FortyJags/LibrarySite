This is the repository for FortyJags Library Website. 
I created this little project to display some of my coding skills. It's made using Express.js with MongoDB for the database. 

Currently it's still a work in progress. As I work through completing this project, I'll be adding a new issue under the 'milestone' label to indicate what part I'll complete next. 

It's designed to mimic a generic library, allowing users to withdraw books or return them and also letting library staff update information about a book, add new books or remove books that are no longer needed. 

If you're reading this, thank you for checking out my project! If you see any issues or you want to suggest an improvement then please raise a new issue.

Thanks

Jags
